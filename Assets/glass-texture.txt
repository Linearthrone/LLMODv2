# Glass Texture Placeholder
# 
# This file represents the glass texture used in the UI styling.
# In a production build, this would be replaced with an actual
# PNG image file that provides a subtle glass texture effect.
#
# Recommended texture specifications:
# - Format: PNG with transparency
# - Size: 256x256 pixels (seamless tile)
# - Content: Subtle noise or brushed metal effect
# - Opacity: Very low (10-15%)
#
# The texture is referenced in Styles/Styles.xaml:
# <ImageBrush ImageSource="ms-appx:///Assets/glass-texture.png" Opacity="0.1"/>
#
# For best results, create a subtle noise pattern or brushed metal
# texture that enhances the glassmorphism effect without being
# distracting.
